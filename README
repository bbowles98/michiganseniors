Notes from Trevor about corda:

	couldn't get it fully functional :( it's close though here's what you gotta do. 
	1. Ignore all files in the corda folder other than those in dir "cordapp". You can delete all those loose files and "cordapp-template-kotlin" dir
	2. Worry about 4 files: 
		cordapp\contracts\src\main\kotlin\com\template\TemplateContract.kt
		cordapp\contracts\src\main\kotlin\com\template\TemplateState.kt
		cordapp\workflows\src\main\kotlin\com\template\flows\Flows.kt
		cordapp\build.gradle
	3. /flows
		figure out why Command+.owningKey aren't working. Once that works the node network can run
	4. /build.gradle
		modify the node network so that there's enough hosts so we can make quite a few elections + make a voter node
		
	5.Just needs API functionality so backend can request and then it works
